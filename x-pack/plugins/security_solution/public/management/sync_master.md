# FEATURE: Artifacts by Policy Feature Branch

This file sole purpose is to assist with merging of `elastic/kibana/master` into the feature branch `elastic/kibana/feature/endpoint-artifacts-by-policy` branch in order to ensure the feature branch remains in sync with `master` (and thus minimize the impact when merging back to `master`).



## Last Merge of `master`: 2020.01.14
